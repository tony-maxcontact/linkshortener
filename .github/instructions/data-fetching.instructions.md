# Data Fetching Guidelines

This document outlines the best practices and guidelines for fethcing data in our Next.js application. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency, performance and maintainability across the codebase.

## 1. Use Server Components for Data Fetching

In Next.js ALWAYS use Server Components for data fetching. NEVER use Client Components to fetch data.

## 2. Data Fetching Methods

ALWAYS use the helper function in the /data directory to fetch data. NEVER fetch data directly in the components.

ALL helper functions in the /data directory should use the Drizzle ORM for database interactions.
